# Luminous - AI-Based Wallpaper Creation Tool
Luminous is a project that allows users to create unique wallpapers using artificial intelligence. Users can describe how they want their wallpaper to look by choosing colors, styles, and moods, and the system will generate a custom wallpaper based on that input.

Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to build a tool that creates beautiful wallpapers by understanding what the user wants. It uses smart technology to turn text-based descriptions into images.

Key Features
1. Color Selection
Uses the VIBGYOR colors (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red).

Each color is carefully picked to match different moods and designs.

Supports smooth blending and matching of colors.

2. Image Collection
Collected over 5,000 images from free image sites like Unsplash and Pexels.

Images include nature scenes, abstract patterns, and colorful designs.

Images are edited (rotated, flipped, etc.) to improve variety.

3. AI Image Generation
The project uses AI models to generate new images based on training.

Models are trained to understand color, shapes, and style preferences.

AI tries to create wallpapers that match the userâ€™s description.

4. User Input
Users can select:

A main color (like green, red, blue)

A design style (like abstract or nature)

A mood (like calm or energetic)

They can also type a short description like:

"A calm green wallpaper with soft shapes"

"Energetic red pattern with bold design"

5. Wallpaper Preview
Users can see a sample (preview) of the wallpaper before downloading.

They can make changes to the design if needed.

6. Easy-to-Use Interface
The tool works on computers and mobile phones.

Simple step-by-step layout guides users through the process.

No need for technical knowledge to use the tool.

7. Testing and Feedback
Tested with different users to check how well the tool understands input.

Improved based on feedback to make it more accurate and user-friendly.

8. Final Deployment
The tool can be used online through a web browser.

Can also be made available as a mobile app in the future.

Conclusion
Luminous makes it easy for anyone to create beautiful, custom wallpapers using just a few words. It brings together color, mood, and creativity in one simple tool.
